            <h1>SEGA Saturn Restoration</h1>
            <p>
                A few years ago I bought myself a Japanese SEGA Saturn off of eBay with a broken disk drive. Now, I've gotten it to run games finally using a recent flashcart known as a Saroo. This will be doccumenting my attempts to restore and maximize the hardware and Saroo for playing games again. I've already gotten into a good spot with that, but there's places to go and I want to doccument what I've done. Below is an image of my Saturn.

            <h1>Color Trouble</h1>
            <p>
                For the time being, I have a cheap A/V to HDMI converter cable from Amazon. For a while, I believed the Saturn itself had issues with the A/V output and it still might going off of how it looked prior to being cleaned. However, after cleaning it, the image became a lot more clear and the cable is seemingly the cause of color distortion compared to the original goal. Notice just how more pink the image on the left is.
